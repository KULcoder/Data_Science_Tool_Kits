# DSTK - Data Science Tool Kits

<br/>

This will be a **information & algorithm library**, and is only used to collect some information on the major methods used in data science, with the main purpose of **explain** and **understand** the concept. Industry solution might seek for other optimized solution.

**Remark**:

- This repo is not a integrated python library, which means you have to manfully find the specific method
- This repo utilized *GitHub copilot*
- This repo still depends on some other packages

<br/>

## Specifications

The whole projects is write in `python`.

And all methods input & output type well be assumed to be `NumPy` or `Pandas` datatype

Assertions (error cases) are not implemented.
